        <ul class="tight">
          <li>Processed 253,680 survey responses from the BRFSS dataset, focusing on risk factors for early diabetes.</li>
          <li>Queried and filtered data using SQL, then engineered features related to blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors.</li>
          <li>Trained Random Forest models with SMOTE-based class balancing to reach ~85% accuracy and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.85.</li>
          <li>Used SHAP to inspect feature influence and flag regions of feature space with higher misclassification risk, helping refine potential screening strategies.</li>

        </p>
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>Built Random Forest models on 1,100+ NBA games to forecast game stats and outcomes, achieving R² ≈ 0.837 for key metrics.</li>
          <li>Integrated real-time API data with historical box score statistics to drive up-to-date forecasts.</li>

        <ul class="tight">
          <li>Analyzed 150+ 9-ball games to study shot patterns, pocket preferences, and break outcomes.</li>
          <li>Built multiple regression models in R to test whether certain phases of the game had higher success rates.</li>
          <li>Found a ~16% higher success rate for pocketing balls during the middle phase of games and no significant advantage from initial break performance or dominant hand.</li>

        <ul class="tight">
          <li>Analyzed ~40 years of NBA team data to quantify how offensive and defensive profiles have evolved.</li>
          <li>Showed that 3-point efficiency is roughly a 30% stronger predictor of team success than traditional defensive metrics in modern eras.</li>
          <li>Built predictive models for offensive and defensive ratings, informing how perimeter shooting has come to dominate championship outcomes.</li>

        <ul class="tight">
          <li>Analyzed data from 100+ schools to study how violent and non-violent crime correlate with SAT performance.</li>
          <li>Found that violent crime showed a negative correlation (~–0.45) with SAT scores, while non-violent crime had negligible association.</li>
          <li>Modeled SAT score trajectories using school demographics and city infrastructure metrics, offering potential insights for policymakers.</li>
